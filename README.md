# even-parity-vlsi

Problem:
Design and Implement a circuit that has two 8-bit inputs and one 16-bit output to perform the following tasks based on the user choice determined by C0 and C1.

Case 11:
the circuit generates the even parity of the second input and show the result in the most significant bit of the output.
